[x]Undo
[]Best out of ____
	every victory adds one to Tournament.p2gamesWon (or p1gamesWon), undo will decrement this value
	setUpNextTournamentGAme will see if sum of victories for both equal number of games to win
		if not equal just reset same game (will probably need to set score values to 0)
	[]tournament ends prematurely, probably the way function victorIsDecided at fault here 
		(in setup new tournament game use victor decided together with checking if nmber of games player is correct)
		maybe just leave victory condition decision the same, just get rid of message, let winner be sent to next 
			round and then pop winner if not final game

[x]Add participants mid tournament
	just add them to the stack in the tournament class
[]show brackets????
[x]Properly undo already won game
	It works, but server change might be messed up
	(1s1wC,1s2wC,1s1wN,1s2wN,2s1wC,2s2wC,2s1wN,2s2wN)
	now if server won, it changes color to gray for everything
	
	
[x]doesn't display all of the tournament games anymore
[x]show round number on top
[x]new round message seems to be displayed multiple times
	(I think it started again, look at how many times event handler is assigned a function)
[x]deal with removal of players mid tournament (ones scheduled for next round don't work again)
[x]no option to continue when first game of tournament is exited 
	(function that returns whether there's a victor returns wrong value)
[]sound for champion
[x]List of participants does not save when participant is removed
[x]deal with multiple clicks on Continue and new tournament buttons (Optional)
	reset button, and new game button => disable until action is finished
[x]Fix Undo button on continue being disabled
[x]alphabetize participants
